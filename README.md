# LogIn
A simple USB password barrier.

All information required to use and modify LogIn is on the [Wiki](https://github.com/Snowball2047/LogIn/wiki).

### Disclaimer!
This program is quite easy to bypass with a bit of know how (showing both hidden and important system folders will reveal the 'Main' folder). This program more useful as a deterrent, rather than a blown way to protect your data. If you want to fully protect your data; consider investing in a paid USB protector, rather than a Java program that was made over a weekend.
